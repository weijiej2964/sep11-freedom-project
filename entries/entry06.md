### Context

After finalizing my project MVP, adding a simple login page and setting up firebase authentication. This addition allows the user to secure their post from being edited and also displays the creator of the post. Following the completion of my project MVP is an expo to show off our project. During the expo we had judges going to each person's project to inspect and give scores for their elevator pitches and project. After the expo we also had to create a presentation revolving around our freedom project. The presentation would include a hook, content and a conclusion slide. 

#### Takeaways from Expo

During the expo, when the judges came to ask about our project, we spoke quickly through our [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18cC79b3IPXsjRGS_2mBuy-De_MgeOB-5jVwiqL6xiDI/edit?usp=sharing). We didn't properly introduce ourselves enough as we assumed it was not necessary. We moved on to explain the creation of accounts and the authentication aspect of our project. We used a pre-created account so it would take less time and the home page loaded without error. We displayed how we can see each post from other people and also create their own post. With a image address already on the clipboard we shown them how the creation was done. After the post was created we show how to edit their own post but not others. After the showcase demo they didn't have a question but instead made a joke upon one of the posts. Although no big errors occurred during our demo, we figure it wasn't interesting enough to get their interest. 

One thing I would change would be giving a more proper elevator pitch instead of moving on quickly to our project. I feel because of this we didn't leave a good representation of ourselves. 

On the other hand, I feel that the demo was smooth sailing the whole way with no errors that occur. We also explained step by step on how it functions.

#### Takeaways from Presentation

For the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D6dm9_RRVJfqVNBE-yQC3ERYfOzlHSxmHqKHOf21sfI/edit?usp=sharing) we created an animated hook and cleaver way to reference the codes we used. We connected our project to a bulletin board and the functions as tools. For example we explained the adding of posts as putting post-its onto the board, deleting as throwing it into the trash can and editing as using whiteouts. However this idea at first caused a conflict between me and my partner Ronnie. He thinks that our presentation might have been too silly which would deduct points from our total score. On the first day of presenting, we saw two projects with a different approach, they were not silly like ours. We were called upon on the first day, we tried our best to connect the idea of bulletin boards to our project. Although we still had doubts on our idea, it was too late. However I think overall we did great on conveying our ideas to the other students. 

One thing I would add would be the firebase backend of our project. Unlike other firebase presentations, we didn't include much of the backend but instead focused on the functions of the imported functions. This is because setting up a firebase is something that is repeatable which doesn't really affect the outcome of our project, but showing the firestore and our firebase console is definitely something we would have added.
