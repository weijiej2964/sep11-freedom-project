# Entry 2
##### 12/13/2021

Since my last blog entry I had been tinkering with firebase commands. I found out that since the update of firebase 9, many of the tutorials have been outdated and the startup will not work. However after reading the documentation and updated firebase 9 tutorials, I found that commands needed to be individually imported. This new thing is called treeshaking.
