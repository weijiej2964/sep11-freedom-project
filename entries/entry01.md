# Defining my project
##### 11/8/2021

### Context

As a huge gamer and weeb myself, I always look up for guides and videos for help throughout my gameplay. However much knowledge gets thrown out of my head after an hour or so. Therefore, I want to make a website that can contain all of that knowledge so I won't have to. The tool I will try to use is Firebase. Using [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) and [firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) mechanics, I can store info and also give others a way to store their knowledge. 

According to [research](https://www.learnupon.com/blog/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve/), people usually tend to forget new information after an hour of learning it. More reasons for why I chose a website to store info or notes on games and advance forward from that. Moreover, as mentioned by [University of Massachusetts](https://www.umassd.edu/dss/resources/students/classroom-strategies/why-take-notes/). Taking notes helps focus and learn. Even if you forget you can reference back later. 

### EDP
I am currently on stage 1 of the engineering design process. Defining what I want to do for my freedom project. I will study ways to work with firebase auth and firebase firestore. So far in SEP class, we have learnt variables, arrays, and conditionals. This builds the basics of javascript and unlock many ways to work with the knowledge of each skill. 

### Skills

The skills I learnt from JS so far and in this project is organization. Each array, function and conditions is required to be clearly organized to understand and remember the property of the code. In addition, firebase makes the coding more complex with ID and configs and different firebase commands. So organization would be utmost important to sort each property into a clear build.
