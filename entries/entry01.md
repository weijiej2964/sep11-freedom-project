# Defining my project
##### 11/8/2021

### Context

As a huge gamer and weeb myself, I always look up for guides and videos for help throughout my gameplay. Although much knowledge gets thrown out of my head after an hour or so. Therefore, I want to make a website that can contain all of that knowledge so I won't have to. The tool I will try to use is Firebase. Using firebase's auth and firestore mechanics, I can store info and also give others a way to store their knowledge.
