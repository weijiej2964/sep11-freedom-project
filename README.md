# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Weijie, Jiang

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about learning javascript tools and using it to create unique websites. The purpose of this blog is to talk about my steps towards creating my project and my experience with learning firebase and webpack. 
## Content
For my project, I am making a bulletin board-like website that will be able to help people share information and ideas. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Firebase in order to make a database API to store the necessary information such as user and posts.

## Implications
Our project is helpful towards those who want to share ideas and information. Building networks and sharing cultures are possible uses for this project. For those who are interested in sharing ideas such as a recipe, this project will allow the user to create posts with title, description and notes. The user will also be able to place an image for the recipes so it will be useful for individuals to share their cultural recipe. 

Another possible user type are people who are interested in networking. Users with interests in knowing new people can post their media account or gmail for people to know. Using the image section for a profile and other places for their media reference. Since this website is a public service, your media will be public for everyone to be able to see. 

However one negative part about my project is that there are no filters. Meaning people can post questionable images, links or words that might not be apporatate. Therefore this site is not recommended towards children or government uses.
